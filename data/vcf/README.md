The following VCF files have been deposited at the European Variation Archive (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eva/?Home) under study accession number PRJEB75494. All dataset contain bi-allelic SNPs only, filtered by missing data (max 10 %) and various quality metrics.

Datasets prefixed 'phyps' were genotyped using hamlet (genus *Hypoplectrus*) sequencing data only, those prefixed 'phylo' were genotyped using hamlet (genus *Hypoplectrus*) and outgroup (genus *Serranus*) sequencing data. Additional filters are described below.
